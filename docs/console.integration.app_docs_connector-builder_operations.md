# Operations

Operation are used to extend the API of external application with functionality that is not supported by it natively, but could be re-used across integrations.

Example of situations when operations could be useful:

- Getting information about the current connection (i.e. account connection is created for).
- Complex transformations of data received from / sent to API (i.e. parsing of raw email body).
- Combining multiple API calls in a way that is commonly used (i.e. query list of ids of object and then query their details in a separate request).

Integration.app is free to try. It takes just one click to get started.
