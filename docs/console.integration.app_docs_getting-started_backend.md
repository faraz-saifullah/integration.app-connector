# Connecting your backend to Integration App

To connect your backend to integration.app, you need one or both of these:

1. Make requests from your backend to integration.app.
2. Configure integration.app to make requests to your backend.

Here is how you do it.

#### [Using Rest API](https://console.integration.app/docs/getting-started/backend/rest-api)

Configuring and running your integrations via an API.

#### [Connecting Your App API](https://console.integration.app/docs/membrane/interfaces/internal-api)

Allowing integration.app to access your API when running integrations.

Integration.app is free to try. It takes just one click to get started.
