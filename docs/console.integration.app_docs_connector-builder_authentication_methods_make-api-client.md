# Make API Client

The `makeApiClient` method configures how your connector will make API requests to the external service.

This method is required for all authentication types and creates a REST API client with the appropriate authentication headers, base URL, and other configuration settings.

## Implementation

You can implement this method in two ways:

### YAML Mapping (Recommended)

Most API clients can be configured using a YAML mapping file:

```yaml
# File: auth/make-api-client.map.yml
baseUri: https://api.example.com
headers:
  Authorization:
    $concat:
        - "Bearer "
        - $var: credentials.access_token
```

In your spec.yml:

```yaml
auth:
  # ...other auth settings
  makeApiClient:
    implementationType: mapping
```

Available fields:

- `baseUri` \- base URL for all API requests.
- `headers` \- default headers to include in all requests.
- `query` \- default query parameters to include in all requests.
- `auth` \- parameters for basic authentication:

  - `username`
  - `password`
- `responseHandlers` \- list of response handlers to apply to all responses (see below).

### JavaScript Implementation

For more complex API clients, you can use Javascript / Typescript code.

It should export a default function that returns RestApiClient instnace.

Example:

```javascript
// File: auth/make-api-client.js
exports.makeApiClient = function({ credentials }) {
  return {
    baseUrl: 'https://api.example.com',
    headers: {
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${credentials.access_token}`,
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      'Accept': 'application/json'
    },
  };
};
```

In your spec.yml:

```yaml
auth:
  # ...other auth settings
  makeApiClient:
    implementationType: javascript
```

## Response Handlers

By default, API client will handle responses using the following logic:

- status >= 200 && status < 300 - return response.
- status == 401 - throw ACCESS\_TOKEN\_EXPIRED error that will trigger an attempt to refresh credentials (if possible).
- status == 429 - throw RATE\_LIMIT\_EXCEEDED error that will lead to retrying the request with exponential backoff until timeout is reached.

You can augment or override this logic by providing a list of response handlers. Each handler consists of:

- A filter that checks response status, headers, or data and returns true if the handler should be applied.
- A flag that indicates whether it is a successful request or an error should be thrown.
- Data that will be returned if request is successful (by default, the response body will be returned).
- Error that will be thrown if the request is not successful.

Example:

```yaml
responseHandlers:
  - match:
      $eval:
        $var: response.data.category
      is: EXPIRED_AUTHENTICATION
    isSuccess: false
    error:
      message: Access token has expired
      key: access_token_expired
      data:
        $var: response.data
```

Handler configuration fields:

- `match` \- [Formula](https://console.integration.app/docs/membrane/references/formulas) that returns true or false based on the response.
- `isSuccess` \- flag that indicates whether it is a successful request or an error should be thrown.
- `error` \- error that will be thrown if the request is not successful. Error fields:

  - `message` \- error message.
  - `key` \- error key (one of the available keys of ConnectionError type)
  - `data` \- additional data to include in the error.

## Best Practices

1. **Base URL**: Minimize prefixes you add to the base URL. Avoid adding API version or other things that may change in the future.
2. **Logging**: Consider adding logging for debugging API issues. All the logs will be available as connection logs when connection happens.
