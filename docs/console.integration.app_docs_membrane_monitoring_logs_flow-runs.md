# Flow Runs

Flow Runs![Flow Runs](https://console.integration.app/images/docs/flow-runs.png)

Whenever a [Flow](https://console.integration.app/docs/membrane/interfaces/flows) runs, we record the following:

- What launched the flow (an event, schedule, or an API call).
- Flow inputs.
- Runs of every node in the flow.
- Logs of every run:
  - Data transformations.
  - API requests.

You can see the list of runs on the [Flow Runs](https://console.integration.app/w/0/activity/flow-runs) page.

Learn more about flow runs here: [Flow Runs](https://console.integration.app/docs/membrane/monitoring/logs/flow-runs).

Integration.app is free to try. It takes just one click to get started.
