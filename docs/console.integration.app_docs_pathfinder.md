# Pathfinder

Pathfinder is a hybrid intelligence for building integration use cases.

It helps you accomplish the following:

- Implement an end-to-end prototype of your integration use case.
- Build new connectors or modify existing ones.
- Scale use case to more external APIs.
- Troubleshoot / improve integration use cases.

Pathfinder works like this:

Pathfinder Overview![Pathfinder Overview](https://console.integration.app/images/docs/pathfinder-overview.jpg)

1. You submit a Pathfinder request describing what you want to be built.
2. Our team member is assigned to coordinate your request.
3. AI guided by our team works in short iterations and sends you an update after each iteration.
4. You can provide feedback and/or change the direction of work at any time.

Using Pathfinder is like having a world-class AI-powered integration team working on your product.

## Getting Started

To get started with Pathfinder, simply send us a message through one of the communication channels
or use the "Build with Pathfinder" button in the integration console.

If it is your first time using Pathfinder, we will ask the approval of your billing admin and
set up the monthly budget for Pathfinder requests.

We will let you know when this is done and we started work on your request.

## Iterations

Pathfinder works in short iterations, each taking from 1 hour to 3 days on average.
Depending on your subscription plan, you may have different SLA for the average duration of an iteration
and a number of parallel iterations.

Each iteration is a session of AI-powered development work done by one of the members of our Solutions team.

After each iteration, you will get an update with details on what was done and any additional information
or decisions we need from you to continue.

## Dashboard

After you enable Pathfinder in your account, you will get access to the Pathfinder dashboard with
full details about your requests, completed iterations, and spending.

## Pricing and Billing

Each Pathfinder Credit costs $50. Each iteration costs from 1 to 5 credits based on the amount of work
and compute resources used. We can give you a ballpark estimate of the cost of your request ahead of time,
but never commit to a fixed cost due to high uncertainty and flexible nature of integration development.

Used pathfinder credits will be added to your monthly usage invoice.
