**Task**  
Build a simple app that creates Contacts in an integrated CRM.

**Usage Scenario**

1. Connect a CRM  
2. Fill out a form with the following fields: Full Name, Email, Phone, Company Name, Pronouns  
3. Click "Create Contact"  
4. Wait for the contact to be created (display some sort of loader)  
5. Display a link to the created contact in the CRM

**Implementation Suggestions**

* Use HubSpot and Pipedrive for testing. Both offer easy trial setups.  
* Leverage our React SDK to simplify frontend development. Also we recommend using Next.js for the whole app in general, but this is up to you.  
* Make sure the form includes all the fields listed above.  
* Think through possible edge cases – identifying and handling them is part of the task.

**Evaluation Criteria**

We’ll look at:

* Your approach to the integration logic  
* Code structure and readability  
* The overall user experience. The goal isn’t to build something beautiful, but something practical that you could confidently show as a working example to a potential customer.

Feel free to ask us any number of questions or make your own assumptions. There’s no single “correct” solution – use us as a sounding board, not for step-by-step guidance.

**Submission**

As a result please submit:

1. Code Source  
2. Short video of you explaining the solution (imagine you are sending it to a customer)  
3. Link to the Live Demo (eg deployed on Vercel)
